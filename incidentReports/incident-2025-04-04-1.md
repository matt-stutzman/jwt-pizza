On Friday, April 4, between 14:36 UTC and 14:38 UTC, users attempting to use JWT pizza were unable to order pizzas because of a factory failure. This was due to an unusually large number of pizza orders coming in quick succession. Lots of orders each ordering a large number of pizzas caused this issue. This critical incident affected all users. 

This incident was detected when our metrics showed an unusually high number of pizza creation failures starting at 14:36 UTC. Our OnCall team was notified via text at 14:37 UTC about the incident and our team was able to investigate immediately. Our team noticed the increased number of creation failures and checked our system logs. The logs indicated that large numbers of orders were being made and the factory was unable to complete the order requests. Our team communicated with the factory about the failure to create pizzas to resolve the issue. Systems showed that the issue was resolved at 14:38 UTC. Systems were monitored after the resolution to make sure that all systems were healthy and functioning as intended.

Our system was updated to better keep track of how many users were affected so JWT Pizza can better understand the scope of future failures.
