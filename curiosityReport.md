I develop 3d visualizations in vr for my internship. When I first started, one of the first things I asked about was automated testing. We don't use an automated testing framework, so for my curiosity report, I wanted to look more into what automated testing frameworks are out there for the work that I do. For background, I use the Unity game engine (which uses C#), and an additional VR framework called Mixed Reality Toolkit (MRTK) that enables extended reality (XR) interactions. 

The first thing I came across was the Unity Testing Framework. It's an additional package that can be added to Unity projects. According to Unity's documentation, it extends NUnit which is a testing framework for .NET platforms. Unity Testing Framework can be used for standalone testing as well as testing for mobile platforms (iOS and Android). It can test in both edit and play mode and is built right into Unity's editor and according to Unity works like test runners in Visual Studio or other IDEs. When looking at an example test, Unity's testing framework looks very similar to Playwright in that it's testing UI. I don't think that there is a way to record user input like Playwright does, so events like Press(mouse.leftButton) need to be scripted by hand. It also tests keyboard actions, like for moving a character around.
